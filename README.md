# moonEclipse
Generate random images through a moon-shaped filter

This was the final project for a course on creative code I completed at Domestika.

It was inspired by a moon eclipse I saw a couple of years ago, when all the light looked little millions of 'little moons.'

## Tech stack
It uses canvas-sketch, a JavaScript library.
